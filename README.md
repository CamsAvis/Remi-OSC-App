## Purpose
To allow users to save and load the state of their avatar live and in game **(when combined with a compatible avatar)**.  Avatar State Saver does **not** require mods - instead it makes use of the [Open Sound Control Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Sound_Control) as suppored by [VRChat](https://hello.vrchat.com/) to communicate with your avatar directly.
